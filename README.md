## Introduction:
The game I got the idea from it was from the Kakegurui manga and putting the game they played into more general terms.

## Rules:
1) Each player is in charge of a nation
2) Players will be going to war with each other
3) There are a certain number of rounds
4) Each round a player must choose to “Attack” or “Defend”
5) Attackers can choose as many “nations” to attack
6) Defenders will choose to defend themselves from everything
7) After everyone makes their decision, the game will show the results of the round
8) The results depend on what each person in the game they decided to do
9) If you attack a nation that also chose “Attack”, you gain points and the nation attacked loses those points
10) If you attack a nation that chose “Defend”, you lose points and the nation that defended gains those points
11) Choosing “Defend” comes at a cost of points and other nations gain those points split evenly
12) Players can send “requests” to other “nations” asking them to “Attack” or “Defend”
13) Players can reply back to those “requests” but they don’t have to
14) There’s no penalty for not obeying a request

## Changes:
1) There are as many “nations” as we can set it to or have a limit on how many “nations” there are
2) We can have usernames set as their “nations” or have something else instead
3) Everyone can have a unique icon that we can set to a square box
4) The number of rounds can also be changed to what the person wants
5) We can set a timer for the people to choose an option within that time or else it’ll automatically choose defend
6) All this would be decided on something like a button “Host a Game”, “Public Game”, “Private Game”
7) The points stated would be a multiple of the number of opponents (in the game, everyone had 5 opponents meaning attacking a nation would grant double the opponents and defending would cost those 5 points)
8) After any round, a player can request a change in the multiplier.
9) For an online version, there would be a sort of chatbox if someone wanted to make conversion beyond the “requests” or make it to forgo the whole request and put chatboxes to be private between each player substituting the “requests”
